We're being particularly careful about making sure that all of our input elements
are surrounded by ``<label>`` elements, so that browsers could provide useful
hints for visually-impaired users. This is very good practice but not strictly
required, so you could also get the same effective results in most browsers by
leaving out the ``<label>`` elements.
